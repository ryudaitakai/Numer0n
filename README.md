I hope you enjoy it.

# rule
I'll introduce how to play Numer0n.

There are two players.
At first, players choose a 3-digit number each other.
Then, you're ready.
The player who guesses the opponent's number first wins this game.

The players call the number.
The way of answer is decided.
Answer the count of EAT and BITE.
EAT means the place and the nuber are correct.
BITE means the number is correct but the place isn't correct.

For example : the answer is 804
```
Please enter a 3-digit number : 578
EAT : 0
BITE : 1
```
8 is incorrect the place but the number is correct.
So BITE is 1.
```
Please enter a 3-digit number : 108
EAT : 1
BITE : 1
```
0 is correct the place and the number.
8 is incorrect the place but the number is correct.
So EAT is 1 and BITE is 1.

The Players refer EAT and BITE to guess the number.
